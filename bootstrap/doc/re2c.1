.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBre2c [OPTIONS] INPUT_FILE [\-o OUTPUT_FILE]\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Re2c is a lexer generator for C/C++. It finds regular expression specifications
inside of C/C++ comments and compiles them to a deterministic finite state
machine. The user should write some \fI\%interface code\fP in order to bind the
generated lexer to the program environment.
Sections \fI\%EOF handling\fP and \fI\%buffer refilling\fP explain how the generated lexer
checks for the end of input and (if necessary) asks for more input.
Various re2c features are described in sections \fI\%include files\fP,
\fI\%header files\fP, \fI\%submatch extraction\fP, \fI\%storable state\fP, \fI\%reusable blocks\fP,
\fI\%encoding support\fP, \fI\%start conditions\fP, \fI\%skeleton programs\fP and
\fI\%visualization and debug\fP\&.
Re2c provides a lot of \fI\%options\fP, \fI\%configurations\fP and \fI\%directives\fP that
allow one to customize the generated code.
.SH OPTIONS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB\-? \-h \-\-help\fP
Show help message.
.TP
.B \fB\-1 \-\-single\-pass\fP
Deprecated. Does nothing (single pass is the default now).
.TP
.B \fB\-8 \-\-utf\-8\fP
Generate a lexer that reads input in UTF\-8 encoding.
re2c assumes that character range is 0 \-\- 0x10FFFF and character size is
1 byte.
.TP
.B \fB\-b \-\-bit\-vectors\fP
Optimize conditional jumps using bit masks. Implies \fB\-s\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\-c \-\-conditions \-\-start\-conditions\fP
Enable support of Flex\-like "conditions": multiple interrelated lexers
within one block. Option \fB\-\-start\-conditions\fP is a legacy alias; use
\fB\-\-conditions\fP instead.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-case\-insensitive\fP
Treat single\-quoted and double\-quoted strings as case\-insensitive.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-case\-inverted\fP
Invert the meaning of single\-quoted and double\-quoted strings:
treat single\-quoted strings as case\-sensitive and double\-quoted strings
as case\-insensitive.
.TP
.B \fB\-e \-\-ecb\fP
Generate a lexer that reads input in EBCDIC encoding.
re2c assumes that character range is 0 \-\- 0xFF an character size is 1 byte.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-empty\-class <match\-empty | match\-none | error>\fP
Define the way re2c treats empty character classes. With \fBmatch\-empty\fP
(the default) empty class matches empty input (which is illogical, but
backwards\-compatible). With\(ga\(gamatch\-none\(ga\(ga empty class always fails to match.
With \fBerror\fP empty class raises a compilation error.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-encoding\-policy <fail | substitute | ignore>\fP
Define the way re2c treats Unicode surrogates.
With \fBfail\fP re2c aborts with an error when a surrogate is encountered.
With \fBsubstitute\fP re2c silently replaces surrogates with the error code
point 0xFFFD. With \fBignore\fP (the default) re2c treats surrogates as
normal code points. The Unicode standard says that standalone surrogates
are invalid, but real\-world libraries and programs behave in different ways.
.TP
.B \fB\-f \-\-storable\-state\fP
Generate a lexer which can store its inner state.
This is useful in push\-model lexers which are stopped by an outer program
when there is not enough input, and then resumed when more input becomes
available. In this mode users should additionally define \fBYYGETSTATE()\fP
and \fBYYSETSTATE(state)\fP macros and variables \fByych\fP, \fByyaccept\fP
and \fBstate\fP as part of the lexer state.
.TP
.B \fB\-F \-\-flex\-syntax\fP
Partial support for Flex syntax: in this mode named definitions don\(aqt need
the equal sign and the terminating semicolon, and when used they must be
surrounded by curly braces. Names without curly braces are treated as
double\-quoted strings.
.TP
.B \fB\-g \-\-computed\-gotos\fP
Optimize conditional jumps using non\-standard "computed goto" extension
(which must be supported by the C/C++ compiler). re2c generates jump tables
only in complex cases with a lot of conditional branches. Complexity
threshold can be configured with \fBcgoto:threshold\fP configuration. This
option implies \fB\-b\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\-I PATH\fP
Add \fBPATH\fP to the list of locations which are used when searching for
include files. This option is useful in combination with
\fB/*!include:re2c ... */\fP directive. Re2c looks for \fBFILE\fP in the
directory of including file and in the list of include paths specified by
\fB\-I\fP option.
.TP
.B \fB\-i \-\-no\-debug\-info\fP
Do not output \fB#line\fP information. This is useful when the generated code
is tracked by some version control system or IDE.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-input <default | custom>\fP
Specify re2c input API.
Option \fBdefault\fP is the default API composed of pointer\-like primitives
\fBYYCURSOR\fP, \fBYYMARKER\fP, \fBYYLIMIT\fP etc.
Option \fBcustom\fP is the generic API composed of function\-like primitives
\fBYYPEEK()\fP, \fBYYSKIP()\fP, \fBYYBACKUP()\fP, \fBYYRESTORE()\fP etc.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-input\-encoding <ascii | utf8>\fP
Specify the way re2c parses regular expressions.
With \fBascii\fP (the default) re2c handles input as ASCII\-encoded: any
sequence of code units is a sequence of standalone 1\-byte characters.
With \fButf8\fP re2c handles input as UTF8\-encoded and recognizes multibyte
characters.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-lang <c | go>\fP
Specify the output language (the default is \fBc\fP).
.TP
.B \fB\-\-location\-format <gnu | msvc>\fP
Specify location format in messages.
With \fBgnu\fP locations are printed as \(aqfilename:line:column: ...\(aq.
With \fBmsvc\fP locations are printed as \(aqfilename(line,column) ...\(aq.
Default is \fBgnu\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-no\-generation\-date\fP
Suppress date output in the generated file.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-no\-version\fP
Suppress version output in the generated file.
.TP
.B \fB\-o OUTPUT \-\-output=OUTPUT\fP
Specify the \fBOUTPUT\fP file.
.TP
.B \fB\-P \-\-posix\-captures\fP
Enable submatch extraction with POSIX\-style capturing groups.
.TP
.B \fB\-r \-\-reusable\fP
Allows reuse of re2c rules with \fB/*!rules:re2c */\fP and \fB/*!use:re2c */\fP
blocks. Exactly one rules\-block must be present. The rules are saved and
used by every use\-block that follows, which may add its own rules and
configurations.
.TP
.B \fB\-S \-\-skeleton\fP
Ignore user\-defined interface code and generate a self\-contained "skeleton"
program. Additionally, generate input files with strings derived from the
regular grammar and compressed match results that are used to verify
"skeleton" behavior on all inputs. This option is useful for finding bugs
in optimizations and code generation.
.TP
.B \fB\-s \-\-nested\-ifs\fP
Use nested \fBif\fP statements instead of \fBswitch\fP statements in conditional
jumps. This usually results in more efficient code with non\-optimizing C/C++
compilers.
.TP
.B \fB\-T \-\-tags\fP
Enable submatch extraction with tags.
.TP
.B \fB\-t HEADER \-\-type\-header=HEADER\fP
Generate a \fBHEADER\fP file that contains enum with condition names.
Requires \fB\-c\fP option.
.TP
.B \fB\-u \-\-unicode\fP
Generate a lexer that reads UTF32\-encoded input. Re2c assumes that character
range is 0 \-\- 0x10FFFF and character size is 4 bytes. This option implies
\fB\-s\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\-V \-\-vernum\fP
Show version information in \fBMMmmpp\fP format (major, minor, patch).
.TP
.B \fB\-\-verbose\fP
Output a short message in case of success.
.TP
.B \fB\-v \-\-version\fP
Show version information.
.TP
.B \fB\-w \-\-wide\-chars\fP
Generate a lexer that reads UCS2\-encoded input. Re2c assumes that character
range is 0 \-\- 0xFFFF and character size is 2 bytes. This option implies
\fB\-s\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\-x \-\-utf\-16\fP
Generate a lexer that reads UTF16\-encoded input. Re2c assumes that character
range is 0 \-\- 0x10FFFF and character size is 2 bytes. This option implies
\fB\-s\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.SS Debug options
.sp
The following options allow to visualize and debug the generated programs;
most of them are enabled only in debug builds.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB\-D \-\-emit\-dot\fP
Instead of normal output generate lexer graph in .dot format.
The output can be converted to an image with the help of Graphviz
(e.g. something like \fBdot \-Tpng \-odfa.png dfa.dot\fP).
.TP
.B \fB\-d \-\-debug\-output\fP
Emit \fBYYDEBUG\fP in the generated code.
\fBYYDEBUG\fP should be defined by the user in the form of a void function
with two parameters: \fBstate\fP (lexer state or \-1) and \fBsymbol\fP (current
input symbol of type \fBYYCTYPE\fP).
.TP
.B \fB\-\-dump\-adfa\fP
Debug option: output DFA after tunneling (in .dot format).
.TP
.B \fB\-\-dump\-cfg\fP
Debug option: output control flow graph of tag variables (in .dot format).
.TP
.B \fB\-\-dump\-closure\-stats\fP
Debug option: output statistics on the number of states in closure.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-dump\-dfa\-det\fP
Debug option: output DFA immediately after determinization (in .dot format).
.TP
.B \fB\-\-dump\-dfa\-min\fP
Debug option: output DFA after minimization (in .dot format).
.TP
.B \fB\-\-dump\-dfa\-tagopt\fP
Debug option: output DFA after tag optimizations (in .dot format).
.TP
.B \fB\-\-dump\-dfa\-tree\fP
Debug option: output DFA under construction with states represented as tag
history trees (in .dot format).
.TP
.B \fB\-\-dump\-dfa\-raw\fP
Debug option: output DFA under construction with expanded state\-sets
(in .dot format).
.TP
.B \fB\-\-dump\-interf\fP
Debug option: output interference table produced by liveness analysis of tag
variables.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-dump\-nfa\fP
Debug option: output NFA (in .dot format).
.UNINDENT
.SS Internal options
.sp
The following options are primarily intended for re2c developers; they are
unstable and control re2c internals.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB\-\-dfa\-minimization <moore | table>\fP
Internal option: DFA minimization algorithm used by re2c. The \fBmoore\fP
option is the Moore algorithm (it is the default). The \fBtable\fP option is
the "table filling" algorithm. Both algorithms should produce the same DFA
up to states relabeling; table filling is simpler and much slower and serves
as a reference implementation.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-eager\-skip\fP
Internal option: make the generated lexer advance the input position
eagerly \-\- immediately after reading the input symbol. This changes the
default behavior when the input position is advanced lazily \-\- after
transition to the next state. This option is implied by \fB\-\-no\-lookahead\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-no\-lookahead\fP
Internal option: use TDFA(0) instead of TDFA(1).
This option has effect only with \fB\-\-tags\fP or \fB\-\-posix\-captures\fP options.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-no\-optimize\-tags\fP
Internal optionL: suppress optimization of tag variables (useful for
debugging).
.TP
.B \fB\-\-posix\-closure <gor1 | gtop>\fP
Internal option: specify shortest\-path algorithm used for the construction of
epsilon\-closure with POSIX disambiguation semantics: \fBgor1\fP (the default)
stands for Goldberg\-Radzik algorithm, and \fBgtop\fP stands for "global
topological order" algorithm.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-posix\-prectable <complex | naive>\fP
Internal option: specify the algorithm used to compute POSIX precedence
table. The \fBcomplex\fP algorithm computes precedence table in one traversal
of tag history tree and has quadratic complexity in the number of TNFA
states; it is the default. The \fBnaive\fP algorithm has worst\-case cubic
complexity in the number of TNFA states, but it is much simpler than
\fBcomplex\fP and may be slightly faster in non\-pathological cases.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-stadfa\fP
Internal option:
use staDFA algorithm for submatch extraction. The main difference with TDFA
is that tag operations in staDFA are placed in states, not on transitions.
.UNINDENT
.SH WARNINGS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB\-W\fP
Turn on all warnings.
.TP
.B \fB\-Werror\fP
Turn warnings into errors. Note that this option alone
doesn\(aqt turn on any warnings; it only affects those warnings that have
been turned on so far or will be turned on later.
.TP
.B \fB\-W<warning>\fP
Turn on \fBwarning\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\-Wno\-<warning>\fP
Turn off \fBwarning\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\-Werror\-<warning>\fP
Turn on \fBwarning\fP and treat it as an error (this implies \fB\-W<warning>\fP).
.TP
.B \fB\-Wno\-error\-<warning>\fP
Don\(aqt treat this particular \fBwarning\fP as an error. This doesn\(aqt turn off
the warning itself.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB\-Wcondition\-order\fP
Warn if the generated program makes implicit
assumptions about condition numbering. One should use either the \fB\-t, \-\-type\-header\fP option or
the \fB/*!types:re2c*/\fP directive to generate a mapping of condition names to numbers and then use
the autogenerated condition names.
.TP
.B \fB\-Wempty\-character\-class\fP
Warn if a regular expression contains an empty
character class. Trying to match an empty character class makes no sense: it should always fail.
However, for backwards compatibility reasons \fBre2c\fP allows empty character classes and
treats them as empty strings. Use the \fB\-\-empty\-class\fP option to change the default
behavior.
.TP
.B \fB\-Wmatch\-empty\-string\fP
Warn if a rule is nullable (matches an empty string).
If the lexer runs in a loop and the empty match is unintentional,
the lexer may unexpectedly hang in an infinite loop.
.TP
.B \fB\-Wswapped\-range\fP
Warn if the lower bound of a range is greater than its upper
bound. The default behavior is to silently swap the range bounds.
.TP
.B \fB\-Wundefined\-control\-flow\fP
Warn if some input strings cause undefined
control flow in the lexer (the faulty patterns are reported). This is the
most dangerous and most common mistake. It can be easily fixed by adding
the default rule \fB*\fP which has the lowest priority, matches any code unit, and consumes
exactly one code unit.
.TP
.B \fB\-Wunreachable\-rules\fP
Warn about rules that are shadowed by other rules and will never match.
.TP
.B \fB\-Wuseless\-escape\fP
Warn if a symbol is escaped when it shouldn\(aqt be.
By default, re2c silently ignores such escapes, but this may as well indicate a
typo or an error in the escape sequence.
.TP
.B \fB\-Wnondeterministic\-tags\fP
Warn if a tag has \fBn\fP\-th degree of nondeterminism, where \fBn\fP is greater than 1.
.TP
.B \fB\-Wsentinel\-in\-midrule\fP
Warn if the sentinel symbol occurs in the middle of a rule \-\-\- this may
cause reads past the end of buffer, crashes or memory corruption in the
generated lexer. This warning is only applicable if the sentinel method of
checking for the end of input is used.
It is set to an error if \fBre2c:sentinel\fP configuration is used.
.UNINDENT
.SH SYNTAX
.sp
A re2c program consists of a number of re2c blocks and directives intermixed
with normal C/C++ code. Each re2c block consists of a sequence of named
definitions, configurations and rules that contain regular expressions. The
generated lexer communicates with the outer world by the means of user
interface.
Rules consist of a regular expression followed by a user\-defined action
(semantic action): a block of C/C++ code that is executed in case of successful
match. Semantic action can be either an arbitrary block of code enclosed in
curly braces \fB{\fP and \fB}\fP, or a block of code without curly braces preceded
with \fB:=\fP and ended with a newline that is not followed by a whitespace.
If multiple rules match, longest match takes precedence. If multiple rules match
the same string, the earlier rule takes priority. If \fB\-c \-\-conditions\fP option
is used, then rules have more complex form described in the section about
conditions.  There are two special kinds of rules:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Default rule \fB*\fP which has the lowest priority reagrdless of its place in
the source code, matches any code unit and consumes exactly one code unit.
This rule should always be defined.
.IP \(bu 2
EOF rule \fB$\fP which matches the end of input. This rule should be defined if
the simplified EOF handling method is used.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Named definitions are of the form \fBname = regexp ;\fP where \fBname\fP is an
identifier that consists of letters, digits and underscores, and \fBregexp\fP is a
regular expression. With \fB\-F \-\-flex\-syntax\fP option named definitions are also
of the form \fBname regexp\fP\&. Each name should be defined before it is used.
.SH REGULAR EXPRESSIONS
.sp
re2c uses the following syntax for regular expressions:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fB"foo"\fP case\-sensitive string literal
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\(aqfoo\(aq\fP case\-insensitive string literal
.IP \(bu 2

.IP \(bu 2
\fBR{n,m}\fP repetition of \fBR\fP from \fBn\fP to \fBm\fP times
.IP \(bu 2
\fB(R)\fP just \fBR\fP; parentheses are used to override precedence or for POSIX\-style submatch
.IP \(bu 2
\fBR S\fP concatenation: \fBR\fP followed by \fBS\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fBR | S\fP alternative: \fBR or S\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fBR / S\fP lookahead: \fBR\fP followed by \fBS\fP, but \fBS\fP is not consumed
.IP \(bu 2
\fBname\fP the regular expression defined as \fBname\fP (or literal string \fB"name"\fP in Flex compatibility mode)
.IP \(bu 2
\fB{name}\fP the regular expression defined as \fBname\fP in Flex compatibility mode
.IP \(bu 2
\fB@stag\fP an \fIs\-tag\fP: saves the last input position at which \fB@stag\fP matches in a variable named \fBstag\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fB#mtag\fP an \fIm\-tag\fP: saves all input positions at which \fB#mtag\fP matches in a variable named \fBmtag\fP
.UNINDENT
.sp
Character classes and string literals may contain the following escape sequences:
\fB\ea\fP, \fB\eb\fP, \fB\ef\fP, \fB\en\fP, \fB\er\fP, \fB\et\fP, \fB\ev\fP, \fB\e\e\fP, octal escapes \fB\eooo\fP and hexadecimal escapes \fB\exhh\fP, \fB\euhhhh\fP and \fB\eUhhhhhhhh\fP\&.
.SH INTERFACE CODE
.sp
Below is the list of all symbols which may be used by the lexer in order to interact with the outer world.
These symbols should be defined by the user,

.TP
.B \fBYYCTXMARKER\fP
L\-value of type \fBYYCTYPE *\fP that is used to backup input position of trailing context.
It is needed only if regular expressions use the lookahead operator \fB/\fP\&.

The type of the input characters (\fIcode units\fP).
Usually it should be \fBunsigned char\fP for ASCII, EBCDIC and UTF\-8 encodings,
\fBunsigned short\fP for UTF\-16 or UCS\-2 encodings,
and \fBunsigned int\fP for UTF\-32 encoding.
.TP
.B \fBYYCURSOR\fP
L\-value of type \fBYYCTYPE *\fP that is used as a pointer to the current input symbol.
Initially \fBYYCURSOR\fP points to the first character and is advanced by the lexer during matching.

.TP
.B \fBYYFILL (n)\fP
A function\-like primitive that is called by the lexer when there is not enough input.
\fBYYFILL\fP should return no value and supply at least \fBn\fP additional characters.

.TP
.B \fBYYLIMIT\fP
R\-value of type \fBYYCTYPE *\fP that marks the end of input (\fBYYLIMIT[\-1]\fP should be the last input character).

.TP
.B \fBYYMARKER\fP
L\-value of type \fBYYCTYPE *\fP used to backup input position of successful match.
This might be necessary if there is an overlapping longer rule that might also match.
.TP
.B \fBYYMTAGP (t)\fP

.TP
.B \fBYYMTAGPD (t)\fP
Same as \fBYYMTAGP\fP, except that instead of the current position it should
save the one before it. This is used for staDFA "delayed store" actions.
.TP
.B \fBYYMTAGN (t)\fP
Append default value to the history of \fIm\-tag\fP \fBt\fP (used only with \fB\-T\fP \fB\-\-tags\fP option).

By default \fBre2c\fP operates on input using pointer\-like primitives
\fBYYCURSOR\fP, \fBYYMARKER\fP, \fBYYCTXMARKER\fP, and \fBYYLIMIT\fP\&.
Normally pointer\-like primitives are defined as variables of type \fBYYCTYPE*\fP,
but it is possible to use STL iterators or any other abstraction as long as it syntactically fits into the following use cases:
.INDENT 0.0

.SS Generic API
.sp
If the default input model is too restrictive, then it is possible to use generic input API enabled with \fB\-\-input custom\fP option.
In this mode all input operations are expressed in terms of the primitives below.
These primitives can be defined in any suitable way; one doesn\(aqt have to stick to the pointer semantics.
For example, it is possible to read input directly from file without any buffering,
or to disable \fBYYFILL\fP mechanism and perform end\-of\-input checking on each input character from inside of \fBYYPEEK\fP or \fBYYSKIP\fP\&.

Substitution for
\fBYYSETCONDITION\fP\&. By default re2c generates an argument in
parentheses followed by semicolon after \fBYYSETCONDITION\fP\&. If you need to make

\fBre2c:define:YYSETCONDITION:naked\fP to non\-zero.
.TP
.B \fBre2c:define:YYSETSTATE:naked = 0;\fP
Controls the argument in parentheses and the
semicolon after \fBYYSETSTATE\fP\&. If non\-zero, both argument and the semicolon are

.TP
.B \fBre2c:eof = \-1;\fP
Specifies the sentinel symbol used with EOF rule \fB$\fP to check for the end
of input in the generated lexer. Default value is \fB\-1\fP (EOF rule is not
used). Other possible values include all valid code units. Only decimal
numbers are recognized.
.TP
.B \fBre2c:sentinel = \-1;\fP
Specifies the sentinel symbol used with the sentinel method of checking for
the end of input in the generated lexer (the case when when bounds checking
is disabled with \fBre2c:yyfill:enable = 0;\fP and EOF rule \fB$\fP is not
used). This configuration does not affect code generation. It is used by
re2c to verify that the sentinel symbol is not allowed in the middle of the
rule, and thus prevent possible reads past the end of buffer and crashes in
the generated lexer. Default value is \fB\-1\fP: in this case re2c assumes that
the sentinel symbol is \fB0\fP (which is by far the most common case). Other
possible values include all valid code units. Only decimal numbers are
recognized.

Same as \fB\-x \-\-utf\-16\fP command\-line option.
.TP
.B \fBre2c:indent:string = \(aq\et\(aq;\fP
Specifies the string to use for indentation. Requires a string that contains
only whitespace (unless you need something else for external tools). The easiest
way to specify spaces is to enclose them in single or double quotes.
If you do  not want any indentation at all, you can set this to \(aq\(aq.
.TP
.B \fBre2c:indent:top = 0;\fP
Specifies the minimum amount of indentation to
use. Requires a numeric value greater than or equal to zero.
.TP
.B \fBre2c:labelprefix = \(aqyy\(aq;\fP
Allows one to change the prefix of numbered
labels. The default is \fByy\fP\&. Can be set any string that is valid in
a label name.
.TP
.B \fBre2c:label:yyFillLabel = \(aqyyFillLabel\(aq;\fP
Overrides the name of the \fByyFillLabel\fP label.
.TP
.B \fBre2c:label:yyNext = \(aqyyNext\(aq;\fP
Overrides the name of the \fByyNext\fP label.
.TP
.B \fBre2c:startlabel = 0;\fP
If set to a non zero integer, then the start
label of the next scanner block will be generated even if it isn\(aqt used by
the scanner itself. Otherwise, the normal \fByy0\fP\-like start label is only
generated if needed. If set to a text value, then a label with that
text will be generated regardless of whether the normal start label is
used or not. This setting is reset to 0 after a start label has been generated.
.TP
.B \fBre2c:state:abort = 0;\fP
When not zero and the \fB\-f\fP \fB\-\-storable\-state\fP switch is active, then
the \fBYYGETSTATE\fP block will contain a default case that aborts and a \-1
case will be used for initialization.
.TP
.B \fBre2c:state:nextlabel = 0;\fP
Used when \fB\-f\fP \fB\-\-storable\-state\fP is active to control
whether the \fBYYGETSTATE\fP block is followed by a \fByyNext:\fP label line.
Instead of using \fByyNext\fP, you can usually also use configuration
\fBstartlabel\fP to force a specific start label or default to \fByy0\fP as
a start label. Instead of using a dedicated label, it is often better to
separate the \fBYYGETSTATE\fP code from the actual scanner code by placing a
\fB/*!getstate:re2c*/\fP comment.
.TP
.B \fBre2c:tags:expression = \(aq@@\(aq;\fP
Allows one to customize the way re2c addresses tag variables:
by default it emits expressions of the form \fByyt<N>\fP,
but this might be inconvenient if tag variables are defined as fields in a struct,
or for any other reason require special accessors.
For example, setting \fBre2c:tags:expression = p\->@@\fP will result in \fBp\->yyt<N>\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBre2c:tags:prefix = \(aqyyt\(aq;\fP
Allows one to override prefix of tag variables.
.TP
.B \fBre2c:variable:yyaccept = yyaccept;\fP
Overrides the name of the \fByyaccept\fP variable.
.TP
.B \fBre2c:variable:yybm = \(aqyybm\(aq;\fP
Overrides the name of the \fByybm\fP variable.
.TP
.B \fBre2c:variable:yych = \(aqyych\(aq;\fP
Overrides the name of the \fByych\fP variable.
.TP
.B \fBre2c:variable:yyctable = \(aqyyctable\(aq;\fP
When both \fB\-c\fP \fB\-\-conditions\fP and \fB\-g\fP \fB\-\-computed\-gotos\fP are active,
re2c will use this variable to generate a static jump table
for \fBYYGETCONDITION\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBre2c:variable:yystable = \(aqyystable\(aq;\fP
Deprecated.
.TP
.B \fBre2c:variable:yytarget = \(aqyytarget\(aq;\fP
Overrides the name of the \fByytarget\fP variable.
.TP
.B \fBre2c:yybm:hex = 0;\fP
If set to zero, a decimal table will be used. Otherwise, a hexadecimal table will be generated.
.TP
.B \fBre2c:yych:conversion = 0;\fP
When this setting is non zero, re2c automatically generates
conversion code whenever yych gets read. In this case, the type must be
defined using \fBre2c:define:YYCTYPE\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBre2c:yych:emit = 1;\fP
Set this to zero to suppress the generation of \fIyych\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBre2c:yyfill:check = 1;\fP
This can be set to 0 to suppress the generations of
\fBYYCURSOR\fP and \fBYYLIMIT\fP based precondition checks. This option is useful when
\fBYYLIMIT + YYMAXFILL\fP is always accessible.
.TP
.B \fBre2c:yyfill:enable = 1;\fP
Set this to zero to suppress the generation of \fBYYFILL (n)\fP\&. When using this, be sure to verify that the generated
scanner does not read beyond the available input, as allowing such behavior might
introduce severe security issues to your programs.
.TP
.B \fBre2c:yyfill:parameter = 1;\fP
Controls the argument in the parentheses that follow \fBYYFILL\fP\&. If zero, the argument is omitted.
If non\-zero, the argument is generated unless \fBre2c:define:YYFILL:naked\fP is set to non\-zero.

.SH EOF HANDLING
.sp
Re2c provides a number of ways to handle end\-of\-input situation. Which way to
use depends on the complexity of regular expressions, performance
considerations, the need for input buffering and various other factors. EOF
handling is probably the most complex part of re2c user interface \-\-\- it
definitely requires a bit of understanding of how the generated lexer works.
But in return is allows the user to customize lexer for a particular environment
and avoid the unnecessary overhead of generic methods when a simpler method is
sufficient. Roughly speaking, there are four main methods:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
using sentinel symbol (simple and efficient, but limited)
.IP \(bu 2
bounds checking with padding (generic, but complex)
.IP \(bu 2
EOF rule: a combination of sentinel symbol and bounds checking (generic and
simple, can be more or less efficient than bounds checking with padding
depending on the grammar)
.IP \(bu 2
using generic API (user\-defined, so may be incorrect ;])
.UNINDENT
.SS Using sentinel symbol
.sp
This is the simplest and the most efficient method. It is applicable in cases
when the input is small enough to fit into a continuous memory buffer and there
is a natural "sentinel" symbol \-\-\- a code unit that is not allowed by any of the
regular expressions in grammar (except possibly as a terminating character).
Sentinel symbol never appears in well\-formed input, therefore it can be appended
at the end of input and used as a stop signal by the lexer. A good example of
such input is a null\-terminated C\-string, provided that the grammar does not
allow \fBNULL\fP in the middle of lexemes. Sentinel method is very efficient,
because the lexer does not need to perform any additional checks for the end of
input \-\-\- it comes naturally as a part of processing the next character.
It is very important that the sentinel symbol is not allowed in the middle of
the rule \-\-\- otherwise on some inputs the lexer may read past the end of buffer
and crash or cause memory corruption. Re2c verifies this automatically.
Use \fBre2c:sentinel\fP configuration to specify which sentinel symbol is used.
.sp
Below is an example of using sentinel method. Configuration

.SS Bounds checking with padding
.sp
Bounds checking is a generic method: it can be used with any input grammar.
The basic idea is simple: we need to check for the end of input before reading
the next input character. However, if implemented in a straightforward way, this
would be quite inefficient: checking on each input character would cause a major
slowdown. Re2c avoids slowdown by generating checks only in certain key states
of the lexer, and letting it run without checks in\-between the key states.
More precisely, re2c computes strongly connected components (SCCs) of
the underlying DFA (which roughly correspond to loops), and generates only a few
checks per each SCC (usually just one, but in general enough to make the SCC
acyclic). The check is of the form \fB(YYLIMIT \- YYCURSOR) < n\fP, where \fBn\fP
is the maximal length of a simple path in the corresponding SCC. If this
condiiton is true, the lexer calls \fBYYFILL(n)\fP, which must either supply at
least \fBn\fP input characters, or do not return. When the lexer continues after
the check, it is certain that the next \fBn\fP characters can be read safely
without checks.
.sp
This approach reduces the number of checks significantly (and makes the lexer
much faster as a result), but it has a downside. Since the lexer checks for
multiple characters at once, it may end up in a situation when there are a few
remaining input characters (less than \fBn\fP) corresponding to a short path in
the SCC, but the lexer cannot proceed because of the check, and \fBYYFILL\fP
cannot supply more character because it is the end of input. To solve this
problem, re2c requires that additional padding consisting of fake characters is
appended at the end of input. The length of padding should be \fBYYMAXFILL\fP,
which equals to the maximum \fBn\fP parameter to \fBYYFILL\fP and must be generated
by re2c using \fB/*!max:re2c*/\fP directive. The fake characters should not form a
valid lexeme suffix, otherwise the lexer may be fooled into matching a fake
lexeme. Usually it\(aqs a good idea to use \fBNULL\fP characters for padding.
.sp
Below is an example of using bounds checking with padding. Note that the grammar
rule for single\-quoted strings allows arbitrary symbols in the middle of lexeme,
so there is no natural sentinel in the grammar. Strings like \fB"aha\e0ha"\fP are
perfectly valid, but ill\-formed strings like \fB"aha\e0\fP are also possible and
shouldn’t crash the lexer. In this example we do not use buffer refilling,
therefore \fBYYFILL\fP definition simply returns an error. Note that \fBYYFILL\fP
will only be called after the lexer reaches padding, because only then will the
check condition be satisfied.

.SS EOF rule
.sp
EOF rule \fB$\fP was introduced in version 1.2. It is a hybrid approach that tries
to take the best of both worlds: simplicity and efficiency of the sentinel
method combined with the generality of bounds\-checking method. The idea is to
appoint an arbitrary symbol to be the sentinel, and only perform further bounds
checking if the sentinel symbol matches (more precisely, if the symbol class that
contains it matches). The check is of the form \fBYYLIMIT <= YYCURSOR\fP\&.
If this condition is not satisfied, then the sentinel is just an ordinary input
character and the lexer continues. Otherwise this is a real sentinel, and the
lexer calls \fBYYFILL()\fP\&. If \fBYYFILL\fP returns zero, the lexer assumes that it
has more input and tries to re\-match. Otherwise \fBYYFILL\fP returns non\-zero and
the lexer knows that it has reached the end of input. At this point there are
three possibilities. First, it might have already matched a shorter lexeme \-\-\-
in this case it just rolls back to the last accepting state. Second, it might
have consumed some characters, but failed to match \-\-\- in this case it falls
back to default rule \fB*\fP\&. Finally, it might be in the initial state \-\-\- in
this (and only this!) case it matches EOF rule \fB$\fP\&.
.sp
Below is an example of using EOF rule. Configuration \fBre2c:yyfill:enable = 0;\fP
suppresses generation of \fBYYFILL\fP calls (but not the bounds checks).

.SS Using generic API
.sp
Generic API can be used with any of the above methods. It also allows one to use a
user\-defined method by placing EOF checks in one of the basic primitives.
Usually this is either \fBYYSKIP\fP (the check is performed when advancing to the
next input character), or \fBYYPEEK\fP (the check is performed when reading the
next input character). The resulting methods are inefficient, as they check on
each input character. However, they can be useful in cases when the input cannot
be buffered or padded and does not contain a sentinel character at the end. One
should be cautious when using such ad\-hoc methods, as it is easy to overlook
some corner cases and come up with a method that only partially works. Also it
should be noted that not everything can be expressed via generic API: for
example, it is impossible to reimplement the way EOF rule works (in particular,
it is impossible to re\-match the character after successful \fBYYFILL\fP).
.sp
Below is an example of using \fBYYSKIP\fP to perform bounds checking without
padding. \fBYYFILL\fP generation is suppressed using \fBre2c:yyfill:enable = 0;\fP
configuration. Note that if the grammar was more complex, this method might not
work in case when two rules overlap and EOF check fails after a shorter lexeme
has already been matched (as it happens in our example, there are no overlapping
rules).

.SH BUFFER REFILLING
.sp
The need for buffering arises when the input cannot be mapped in memory all at
once: either it is too large, or it comes in a streaming fashion (like reading
from a socket). The usual technique in such cases is to allocate a fixed\-sized
memory buffer and process input in chunks that fit into the buffer. When the
current chunk is processed, it is moved out and new data is moved in. In
practice it is somewhat more complex, because lexer state consists not of a
single input position, but a set of interrelated posiitons:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
cursor: the next input character to be read (\fBYYCURSOR\fP in default API or
\fBYYSKIP\fP/\fBYYPEEK\fP in generic API)
.IP \(bu 2
limit: the position after the last available input character (\fBYYLIMIT\fP in
default API, implicitly handled by \fBYYLESSTHAN\fP in generic API)
.IP \(bu 2
marker: the position of the most recent match, if any (\fBYYMARKER\fP in default
API or \fBYYBACKUP\fP/\fBYYRESTORE\fP in generic API)
.IP \(bu 2
token: the start of the current lexeme (implicit in re2c API, as it is not
needed for the normal lexer operation and can be defined and updated by the
user)
.IP \(bu 2
context marker: the position of the trailing context (\fBYYCTXMARKER\fP in
default API or \fBYYBACKUPCTX\fP/\fBYYRESTORECTX\fP in generic API)
.IP \(bu 2
tag variables: submatch positions (defined with \fB/*!stags:re2c*/\fP and
\fB/*!mtags:re2c*/\fP directives and
\fBYYSTAGP\fP/\fBYYSTAGN\fP/\fBYYMTAGP\fP/\fBYYMTAGN\fP in generic API)
.UNINDENT
.sp
Not all these are used in every case, but if used, they must be updated by
\fBYYFILL\fP\&. All active positions are contained in the segment between token and
cursor, therefore everything between buffer start and token can be discarded,
the segment from token and up to limit should be moved to the beginning of
buffer, and the free space at the end of buffer should be filled with new data.
In order to avoid frequent \fBYYFILL\fP calls it is best to fill in as many input
characters as possible (even though fewer characters might suffice to resume the
lexer). The details of \fBYYFILL\fP implementation are slightly different
depending on which EOF handling method is used: the case of EOF rule is somewhat
simpler than the case of bounds\-checking with padding. Also note that if
\fB\-f \-\-storable\-state\fP option is used, \fBYYFILL\fP has slightly different
semantics (desrbed in the section about storable state).
.SS YYFILL with EOF rule
.sp
If EOF rule is used, \fBYYFILL\fP is a function\-like primitive that accepts
no arguments and returns a value which is checked against zero. \fBYYFILL\fP
invocation is triggered by condition \fBYYLIMIT <= YYCURSOR\fP in default API and
\fBYYLESSTHAN()\fP in generic API. A non\-zero return value means that \fBYYFILL\fP
has failed. A successful \fBYYFILL\fP call must supply at least one character and
adjust input positions accordingly. Limit must always be set to one after the
last input position in buffer, and the character at the limit position must be
the sentinel symbol specified by \fBre2c:eof\fP configuration. The pictures below
show the relative locations of input positions in buffer before and after
\fBYYFILL\fP call (sentinel symbol is marked with \fB#\fP, and the second picture
shows the case when there is not enough input to fill the whole buffer).

.SS YYFILL with padding
.sp
In the default case (when EOF rule is not used) \fBYYFILL\fP is a function\-like
primitive that accepts a single argument and does not return any value.
\fBYYFILL\fP invocation is triggered by condition \fB(YYLIMIT \- YYCURSOR) < n\fP in
default API and \fBYYLESSTHAN(n)\fP in generic API. The argument passed to
\fBYYFILL\fP is the minimal number of characters that must be supplied. If it
fails to do so, \fBYYFILL\fP must not return to the lexer (for that reason it is
best implemented as a macro that returns from the calling function on failure).
In case of a successful \fBYYFILL\fP invocation the limit position must be set
either to one after the last input position in buffer, or to the end of
\fBYYMAXFILL\fP padding (in case \fBYYFILL\fP has successfully read at least \fBn\fP
characters, but not enough to fill the entire buffer). The pictures below show
the relative locations of input positions in buffer before and after \fBYYFILL\fP
invocation (\fBYYMAXFILL\fP padding on the second picture is marked with \fB#\fP

.SH HEADER FILES
.sp
Re2c allows one to generate header file from the input \fB\&.re\fP file using option
\fB\-t \-\-type\-header\fP (or the corresponding configurations) and directives
\fB/*!header:re2c:on*/\fP and \fB/*!header:re2c:off*/\fP\&. The first directive
marks the beginning of header file, and the second directive marks the end of
it. Everything between these directives is processed by re2c, and the generated
code is written to the file specified by the \fB\-t \-\-type\-header\fP option (or
\fBstdout\fP if this option was not used). Autogenerated header file may be needed
in cases when re2c is used to generate definitions of constants, variables and
structs that must be visible from other translation units.
.sp
Here is an example of generating a header that contains definitions of
\fBYYMAXFILL\fP and lexer state with tag variables. Note that \fBYYMAXFILL\fP and
tag variables depend on the grammar in the \fB\&.re\fP file and cannot be
hard\-coded.

.SH SUBMATCH EXTRACTION
.sp
Re2c has two options for submatch extraction.
.sp
The first option is \fB\-T \-\-tags\fP\&. With this option one can use standalone tags
of the form \fB@stag\fP and \fB#mtag\fP, where \fBstag\fP and \fBmtag\fP are arbitrary
used\-defined names. Tags can be used anywhere inside of a regular expression;
semantically they are just position markers. Tags of the form \fB@stag\fP are
called s\-tags: they denote a single submatch value (the last input position
where this tag matched). Tags of the form \fB#mtag\fP are called m\-tags: they
denote multiple submatch values (the whole history of repetitions of this tag).
All tags should be defined by the user as variables with the corresponding
names. With standalone tags re2c uses leftmost greedy disambiguation: submatch
positions correspond to the leftmost matching path through the regular
expression.
.sp
The second option is \fB\-P \-\-posix\-captures\fP: it enables POSIX\-compliant
capturing groups. In this mode parentheses in regular expressions denote the
beginning and the end of capturing groups; the whole regular expression is group
number zero. The number of groups for the matching rule is stored in a variable
\fByynmatch\fP, and submatch results are stored in \fByypmatch\fP array. Both
\fByynmatch\fP and \fByypmatch\fP should be defined by the user, and \fByypmatch\fP
size must be at least \fB[yynmatch * 2]\fP\&. Re2c provides a directive
\fB/*!maxnmatch:re2c*/\fP that defines \fBYYMAXNMATCH\fP: a constant  equal to the
maximal value of \fByynmatch\fP among all rules. Note that re2c implements
POSIX\-compliant disambiguation: each subexpression matches as long as possible,
and subexpressions that start earlier in regular expression have priority over
those starting later. Capturing groups are translated into s\-tags under the
hood, therefore we use the word "tag" to describe them as well.
.sp
With both \fB\-P \-\-posix\-captures\fP and \fBT \-\-tags\fP options re2c uses efficient
submatch extraction algorithm described in the
\fI\%Tagged Deterministic Finite Automata with Lookahead\fP
paper. The overhead on submatch extraction in the generated lexer grows with the
number of tags \-\-\- if this number is moderate, the overhead is barely
noticeable. In the lexer tags are implemented using a number of tag variables
generated by re2c. There is no one\-to\-one correspondence between tag variables
and tags: a single variable may be reused for different tags, and one tag may
require multiple variables to hold all its ambiguous values. Eventually
ambiguity is resolved, and only one final variable per tag survives. When a rule
matches, all its tags are set to the values of the corresponding tag variables.
The exact number of tag variables is unknown to the user; this number is
determined by re2c. However, tag variables should be defined by the user as a
part of the lexer state and updated by \fBYYFILL\fP, therefore re2c provides
directives \fB/*!stags:re2c*/\fP and \fB/*!mtags:re2c*/\fP that can be used to
declare, initialize and manipulate tag variables. These directives have two
optional configurations: \fBformat = "@@";\fP (specifies the template where \fB@@\fP
is substituted with the name of each tag variable), and \fBseparator = "";\fP
(specifies the piece of code used to join the generated pieces for different
tag variables).
.sp

with both default and generic API
.IP \(bu 2

.UNINDENT
.sp
S\-tags can be implemented as scalar values (pointers or offsets). M\-tags need a
more complex representation, as they need to store a sequence of tag values. The
most naive and inefficient representation of an m\-tag is a list (array, vector)
of tag values; a more efficient representation is to store all m\-tags in a
prefix\-tree represented as array of nodes \fB(v, p)\fP, where \fBv\fP is tag value
and \fBp\fP is a pointer to parent node.

.SH STORABLE STATE
.sp
With \fB\-f\fP \fB\-\-storable\-state\fP option re2c generates a lexer that can store
its current state, return to the caller, and later resume operations exactly
where it left off. The default mode of operation in re2c is a "pull" model,
in which the lexer "pulls" more input whenever it needs it. This may be
unacceptable in cases when the input becomes available piece by piece (for
example, if the lexer is invoked by the parser, or if the lexer program
communicates via a socket protocol with some other program that must wait for a
reply from the lexer before it transmits the next message). Storable state
feature is intended exactly for such cases: it allows one to generate lexers that
work in a "push" model. When the lexer needs more input, it stores its state and
returns to the caller. Later, when more input becomes available, the caller
resumes the lexer exactly where it stopped. There are a few changes necessary
compared to the "pull" model:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Define \fBYYSETSTATE()\fP and \fBYYGETSTATE(state)\fP promitives.
.IP \(bu 2
Define \fByych\fP, \fByyaccept\fP and \fBstate\fP variables as a part of persistent
lexer state. The \fBstate\fP variable should be initialized to \fB\-1\fP\&.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBYYFILL\fP should return to the outer program instead of trying to supply more
input. Return code should indicate that lexer needs more input.
.IP \(bu 2
The outer program should recognize situations when lexer needs more input and
respond appropriately.
.IP \(bu 2
Use \fB/*!getstate:re2c*/\fP directive if it is necessary to execute any code
before entering the lexer.
.IP \(bu 2
Use configurations \fBstate:abort\fP and \fBstate:nextlabel\fP to further tweak
the generated code.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Here is an example of a "push"\-model lexer that reads input from \fBstdin\fP and
expects a sequence of words separated by spaces and newlines. The lexer loops
forever, waiting for more input. It can be terminated by sending a special EOF
token \-\-\- a word "stop", in which case the lexer terminates successfully and
prints the number of words it has seen. Abnormal termination happens in case of
a syntax error, premature end of input (without the "stop" word) or in case the
buffer is too small to hold a lexeme (for example, if one of the words exceeds
buffer size). Premature end of input happens in case the lexer fails to read any
input while being in the initial state \-\-\- this is the only case when EOF rule
matches. Note that the lexer may call \fBYYFILL\fP twice before terminating (and
thus require hitting \fBCtrl+D\fP a few times). First time \fBYYFILL\fP is called
when the lexer expects continuation of the current greedy lexeme (either a word
or a whitespace sequence). If \fBYYFILL\fP fails, the lexer knows that it has
reached the end of the current lexeme and executes the corresponding semantic
action. The action jumps to the beginning of the loop, the lexer enters the
initial state and calls \fBYYFILL\fP once more. If it fails, the lexer matches EOF
rule. (Alternatively EOF rule can be used for termination instead of a special
EOF lexeme.)

.SH REUSABLE BLOCKS

Reuse mode is enabled with the \fB\-r \-\-reusable\fP option. In this mode re2c
allows one to reuse definitions, configurations and rules specified by a
\fB/*!rules:re2c*/\fP block in subsequent \fB/*!use:re2c*/\fP blocks. As of
re2c\-1.2 it is possible to mix such blocks with normal \fB/*!re2c*/\fP blocks;
prior to that re2c expects a single rules\-block followed by use\-blocks (normal
blocks are disallowed). Use\-blocks can have additional definitions,
configurations and rules: they are merged to those specified by the rules\-block.
A very common use case for \fB\-r \-\-reusable\fP option is a lexer that supports
multiple input encodings: lexer rules are defined once and reused multiple times
with encoding\-specific configurations, such as \fBre2c:flags:utf\-8\fP\&.

Below is an example of a multi\-encoding lexer: it reads a phrase with Unicode
math symbols and accepts input either in UTF8 or in UT32. Note that the
\fB\-\-input\-encoding utf8\fP option allows us to write UTF8\-encoded symbols in the

would map to Unicode code points in the range 0xD800\-0xDFFF, is
ill\-formed. The user can control how \fBre2c\fP treats such ill\-formed
sequences with the \fB\-\-encoding\-policy <policy>\fP switch.
.sp
For some encodings, there are code units that never occur in a valid
encoded stream (e.g., 0xFF byte in UTF\-8). If the generated scanner must
check for invalid input, the only correct way to do so is to use the default
rule (\fB*\fP). Note that the full range rule (\fB[^]\fP) won\(aqt catch invalid code units when a variable\-length encoding is used
(\fB[^]\fP means "any valid code point", whereas the default rule (\fB*\fP) means "any possible code unit").
.SH START CONDITIONS
.sp
\fIConditions\fP are enabled with \fB\-c\fP \fB\-\-conditions\fP\&.
This option allows one to encode multiple interrelated lexers within the same re2c block.
.sp
Each lexer corresponds to a single \fIcondition\fP\&.
It starts with a label of the form \fByyc_name\fP,
where \fBname\fP is \fIcondition\fP name
and \fByyc\fP prefix can be adjusted with configuration \fBre2c:condprefix\fP\&.
Different lexers are separated with a comment \fB/* *********************************** */\fP
which can be adjusted with configuration \fBre2c:cond:divider\fP\&.
.sp
Furthermore, each \fIcondition\fP has a unique identifier of the form \fByycname\fP,
where \fBname\fP is condition name
and \fByyc\fP prefix can be adjusted with configuration \fBre2c:condenumprefix\fP\&.
Identifiers have the type \fBYYCONDTYPE\fP and should be generated with \fB/*!types:re2c*/\fP directive or \fB\-t\fP \fB\-\-type\-header\fP option.
Users shouldn\(aqt define these identifiers manually, as the order of \fIconditions\fP is not specified.
.sp
Before all \fIconditions\fP re2c generates entry code that checks the current \fIcondition\fP identifier
and transfers control flow to the start label of the active \fIcondition\fP\&.
After matching some rule of this \fIcondition\fP,
lexer may either transfer control flow back to the entry code (after executing the associated action and optionally setting another \fIcondition\fP with \fB=>\fP),
or use \fB:=>\fP shortcut and transition directly to the start label of another \fIcondition\fP (skipping the action and the entry code).
Configuration \fBre2c:cond:goto\fP allows one to change the default behavior.
.sp
Syntactically each rule must be preceded with a list of comma\-separated \fIcondition\fP names or a wildcard \fB*\fP
enclosed in angle brackets \fB<\fP and \fB>\fP\&.
Wildcard means "any condition" and is semantically equivalent to listing all condition names.
Here \fBregexp\fP is a regular expression, \fBdefault\fP refers to the \fIdefault rule\fP \fB*\fP,
and \fBaction\fP is a block of C/C++ code.

.sp
Rules with an exclamation mark \fB!\fP in front of condition list have a special meaning:
they have no regular expression,
and the associated action is merged as an entry code to actions of normal rules.
This might be a convenient place to peform a routine task that is common to all rules.

Another special form of rules with an empty condition list \fB<>\fP and no regular expression
allows one to specify an "entry condition" that can be used to execute code before entering the lexer.
It is semantically equivalent to a condition with number zero, name \fB0\fP and an empty regular expression.

.SH SKELETON PROGRAMS
.sp
With the \fB\-S, \-\-skeleton\fP option, re2c ignores all non\-re2c code and generates
a self\-contained C program that can be further compiled and executed. The
program consists of lexer code and input data. For each constructed DFA (block
or condition) re2c generates a standalone lexer and two files: an \fB\&.input\fP
file with strings derived from the DFA and a \fB\&.keys\fP file with expected match
results. The program runs each lexer on the corresponding \fB\&.input\fP file and
compares results with the expectations.
Skeleton programs are very useful for a number of reasons:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
They can check correctness of various re2c optimizations (the data is
generated early in the process, before any DFA transformations have taken
place).
.IP \(bu 2
Generating a set of input data with good coverage may be useful for both
testing and benchmarking.
.IP \(bu 2
Generating self\-contained executable programs allows one to get minimized test
cases (the original code may be large or have a lot of dependencies).
.UNINDENT
.sp
The difficulty with generating input data is that for all but the most trivial
cases the number of possible input strings is too large (even if the string
length is limited). Re2c solves this difficulty by generating sufficiently
many strings to cover almost all DFA transitions. It uses the following
algorithm. First, it constructs a skeleton of the DFA. For encodings with 1\-byte
code unit size (such as ASCII, UTF\-8 and EBCDIC) skeleton is just an exact copy
of the original DFA. For encodings with multibyte code units skeleton is a copy
of DFA with certain transitions omitted: namely, re2c takes at most 256 code
units for each disjoint continuous range that corresponds to a DFA transition.
The chosen values are evenly distributed and include range bounds. Instead of
trying to cover all possible paths in the skeleton (which is infeasible) re2c
generates sufficiently many paths to cover all skeleton transitions, and thus
trigger the corresponding conditional jumps in the lexer.
The algorithm implementation is limited by ~1Gb of transitions and consumes
constant amount of memory (re2c writes data to file as soon as it is generated).
.SH VISUALIZATION AND DEBUG
.sp
With the \fB\-D, \-\-emit\-dot\fP option, re2c does not generate C/C++ code. Instead,
it dumps the generated DFA in the
\fI\%DOT format\fP\&.
One can convert this dump to an image of the DFA using
\fI\%graphviz\fP or another library.
Note that this option shows the final DFA after it has gone through a number of
optimizations and transformations. Earlier stages can be dumped with various debug
options, such as \fB\-\-dump\-nfa\fP, \fB\-\-dump\-dfa\-raw\fP etc. (see the full
\fI\%list of options\fP).
